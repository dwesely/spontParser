* [[Mitch and Dolores]]

== Notes ==
This is the first live episode, and the first episode where the interview guest participated in the improv. (Colin Hanks plays both Jeremy Piven and the aide who interrupts the speech to announce Jon Lovitz is waiting.)

When Marc Evan Jackson is introduced, Eban plays the theme to the Thrilling Adventure Hour segment &quot;Sparks Nevada, Marshall on Mars&quot;. Eban wrote the song, and Jackson plays the titular Sparks Nevada. Jackson comments that it's a great song.[[Category:Spontaneanation Episodes]]
